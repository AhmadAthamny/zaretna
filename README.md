# Overview - What's this?
My farmer uncle that has been farming for more than 15 years (works as agriculture engineer as well) decided to start selling fruits & vegetables online, delivered directly from the ground to the customer's house, so my elder brother made him a website, and I was there to help in making the "back-office" windows application that manages the website and the business, such as managing orders, products, customers, delivery, statistics and more.

# Managing Products

* Managing products is user-friendly.
* Same product can appear on multiple categories.
* Categories can be added/modified through the same window.
* Specific products order can be made for each category, user friendly editor as well.

# Managing Orders

This is the window to view and manage orders, orders with golden background are prepared (collected) for delivery, while orders with white background are still not collected.
To view an order, we simply click on it, and the following window will open:

When complete, we write the final price of the order (after weighting the products and getting the exact price), then the order will have the golden background.

# Delivery
There's a window for delivery:

We choose the email address the belongs to the delivery man (new email addresses) can be added easily, and an email that contains a table of all prepared orders with details and information about the orders.
Example of an email sent for delivery:



All project files were moved to this Github repository for the first time.

The website is hosted on bluehost.com, the host was supposed to be renewed in the last March (03/2023) in order to keep the website up, but it's currently "under maintenence".

Required packages:
1. MySQL.Data (By Oracle)
